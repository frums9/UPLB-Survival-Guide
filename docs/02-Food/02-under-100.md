# The Breakdown

### 1. WeDeliver (Wedel)
**📍 Location:** Agapita / Raymundo Area.

* **The Order:** Tocilog or Tapsilog.
* **The Vibe:** The "Old Reliable." It’s greasy, it’s fast, and it’s open early. Perfect for breakfast before a 7 AM exam.

:::tip Nyel Efficiency Score: 8.8 / 10
* **Price:** 8/10 (₱55 is standard for Silog).
* **Satiety:** 9/10 (Heavy rice portions).
* **Convenience:** 9/10 (Fast service, widely available tables).
:::

### 2. Aling Baby's
**📍 Location:** Raymundo Gate.

* **The Deal:** The legendary "Student Meal."
* **The Math:** 1 Meat Ulam + 1 Vegetable Ulam + Rice = **₱70**.

:::tip Nyel Efficiency Score: 8.7 / 10
* **Price:** 7/10 (Higher cost, but high value).
* **Micros:** 9/10 (One of the few places guaranteeing vegetables on the plate).
* **Satiety:** 8/10 (A balanced plate keeps you full longer than just carbs).
:::

### 3. Kerby's Food Hub
**📍 Location:** Back of YMCA.

* **The Strategy:** Similar to Aling Baby's, they offer a balanced "Student Meal" combo.
* **The Math:** Meat + Veggie + Rice = **₱65**.

:::info Comparison
Kerby's is slightly cheaper (₱65) than Aling Baby's (₱70), making it a strong alternative if you are near the YMCA side of campus.
:::

### 4. Cantina Hija (by Mommy's Corner)
**📍 Location:** Inside Westbrook Residences.

* **The Draw:** It's not just about the food; it's about the **Free Wifi** and **Clean CR**.
* **The Deal:** Half Meat Ulam + Rice = **₱65**.

:::warning Walking Distance
It is located inside a residential compound (Westbrook), so factor in the walk. Good for studying, bad for a quick 10-minute lunch break.
:::

### 5. Salad Country
**📍 Location:** Student Union (SU) Building.

* **The Order:** Sisig Meal (₱75).
* **The Signal Hack:** Since it's in the SU Building, this spot is a **Green Zone** for signal. Great for eating while checking Canvas or replying to emails.
