## Establishment Breakdown

### 1. Monjo Food Corner
**📍 Location:** Back of LBDH (See Google Maps). It's a bit hidden, look for the small karinderya.

* **The Math:** Rice (₱10) + Half Ulam (₱30) = **₱40**

:::tip Nyel Efficiency Score: 9.5 / 10
* **Price:** 10/10 (₱40 for a plated meal).
* **Satiety:** 9/10 (Community reports say servings are huge).
* **Micros:** 7/10 (Home-cooked style).
:::

### 2. Cadapan Canteen
**📍 Location:** Raymundo, beside K-Go.

* **The Strategy:** Cadapan is famous for their **Fried Chicken**, but if you want to survive, order the **Munggo**. It is nutrient-dense and cheap.

:::tip Nyel Efficiency Score: 9.0 / 10
* **Price:** 9/10 (₱45 is a steal).
* **Satiety:** 8/10 (The free soup fills you up).
* **Micros:** 10/10 (Actual fiber in the Munggo).
:::

### 3. TFTG 
**📍 Location:** Near Grove/Main Gate.

:::warning Reality Check
This is pure survival food. It is tasty (oily), but it has almost zero vegetables. Eat this for energy, not for health.
:::

### 4. Sitio Tambayan
**📍 Location:** Ruby Street

* They are very generous with "Half-Orders" of vegetables.
* Rice (₱10) + Half Veggie (₱20) = **₱30**.

### 5. Aling Baby's Food Haus
**📍 Location:** EC Building, Demarces
* **The Deal:** Rice + Half Monggo (Veggie).
* **Community Report:** A beta tester confirmed the price is ~₱32, making it cheaper than Monjo's.
