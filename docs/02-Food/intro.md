# The UPLB Food Economy

As a fellow student that is in need of cheap and sustainable food during hell week, I wanted to compile a list of establishments that offer nutritious and "worth it" student meals.

## The Problem
In UPLB, food usually falls into a triangle of three qualities, and you can usually only pick two:
1.  **Cheap**
2.  **Delicious**
3.  **Healthy**

If it's cheap and delicious, it's probably unhealthy (Pancit Canton). If it's healthy and delicious, it's expensive (Salads/Steak). If it's cheap and healthy, it usually tastes like cardboard.

## The Solution
### The "Nyel Efficiency Score"
We don't rate food based on how "Instagrammable" it is. We rate it based on **Survival Metrics**, plus points nalang pag Instagrammable. As a broke student, taste is a luxury; efficiency is a requirement.

To objectively rank the best survival meals on campus, I created a custom algorithm out of **10 Points**:

:::info The Efficiency Formula
**Score = (0.4 x Price) + (0.3 x Satiety) + (0.2 x Nutrients) + (0.1 x Convenience)**
:::

### How it Works

#### 1. Price (40% Weight)
*The most critical factor. Lower price = Higher score.*
* **10 pts:** Under ₱40 (The cheaper it is, the better)
* **5 pts:** ₱61 - ₱100
* **1 pt:** Over ₱150 (Only for paydays)

#### 2. Satiety (30% Weight)
*How long will this keep me alive?*
* **10 pts:** High Protein + Fiber (Scientifically keeps you full for 6+ hours).
* **1 pt:** Empty Calories (You will go hungry again in 30 mins).

#### 3. Micro-Nutrients (20% Weight)
* **10 pts:** Visible vegetables or fruit.
* **1 pt:** Pure flour, sugar, or sodium.

#### 4. Convenience (10% Weight)
* **10 pts:** 24/7 access, no lines.
* **1 pt:** 1-hour wait or long walk.
