# Welcome to the UPLB Survival Guide

## What is this?
Hi there! Welcome to UPLB. I am **Mark**, a 1st-year Computer Science student. I am passionate about making community-centric projects, and this is my very first one.

This is a **Budget Guide to Surviving UPLB**, dedicated to students who are interested in finding the **cheapest** ways to survive everyday life while **maximizing** the benefits; hopefully for the ***least*** amount of effort.

If you are a student on a tight budget who doesn't want to risk your peace of mind, this guide is for you.

:::info **"Maximum Survival, Minimum Peso."**
We believe you shouldn't have to starve to save money. You just need to know where to look.

## How to Navigate This Guide
This website is organized into "Survival Categories" visible on the sidebar to your left (or the menu button on mobile).

* **Food Hacks:** Not just *where* to eat, but *what* to eat to get the most protein and calories for your money.
* **Transportation:** Calculated routes for walking vs. jeepneys, including safety tips for late-night travel.
* **Network Strength:** A heat map of where the signal is strong for Smart/Globe so you don't disconnect during an exam.
* **Laundry & Groceries:** Price comparisons for your daily essentials.

## Where to Start?
If you are new here, I recommend checking these pages first:

1.  **[Food Hacks](/docs/Food/intro)** – Figuring out the best options for min-maxing your food in Elbi.

## How to Contribute
This is a **community project**. I cannot eat at every canteen or walk every path alone.

If you know a hidden gem, a cheaper laundry shop, or if a price listed here is outdated, **you can fix it yourself!**

* **The "Edit" Button:** At the bottom of every page, there is a link that says *"Edit this page on GitHub."*
* **The Process:** Click it, make your change, and submit. I will review it and add it to the site.

:::note Work in Progress
This project is still a work in progress. We need YOUR help to find accurate data and hidden gems that can help our fellow UPLB students.
